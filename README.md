## Project setup
For development on the NodeJs / Typescript stack, if you don't already have them, there are a few tools to download:

*  [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Version 6.x.
    * Installing NodeJS also includes NPM which we use as our package management tool.

### Gathering dependencies
The first time you clone a NPM managed project, as well as any time dependencies are added to the project, you can use npm to install all dependencies defined in the package.json via:
```
npm install

For example, to start the server...
````
node server.js

And then open http://localhost:9090

## Configure

config folder json file. Change data base config and give user and password with localhost.
